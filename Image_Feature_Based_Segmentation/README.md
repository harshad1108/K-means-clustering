# Image Feature-Based Segmentation using K-Means

## 📌 Project Description
Image data often contains complex patterns that are difficult to analyze directly.
This project applies **K-Means clustering** on extracted numerical image features
to group images into meaningful segments.

The project demonstrates how unsupervised learning can be extended beyond
traditional tabular data into computer vision–related tasks.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Segment images based on extracted feature values
- Identify visually similar image groups
- Demonstrate K-Means usage on image-based data

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Technique
- K-Means Clustering
- Type: Unsupervised Learning

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of numerical features extracted from images
(e.g., texture, intensity, or statistical features).

Dataset file:
- case5_image_features_kmeans_1000.csv

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Load and explore image feature data
2. Preprocess and scale features
3. Determine optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
4. Apply K-Means clustering
5. Visualize clusters
6. Interpret image groups

---

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Images are grouped into distinct feature-based clusters
- Similar visual patterns fall into the same clusters
- Useful for image categorization and pattern discovery
