# Banking Transaction Behavior Segmentation using K-Means

## 📌 Project Description
Banks collect large volumes of transaction data from customers every day. 
Analyzing this data manually is difficult and inefficient.  
This project uses **K-Means clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, 
to segment customers based on their transaction behavior and usage patterns.

The segmentation helps banks understand different customer groups and improve 
personalized services, offers, and engagement strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Segment customers based on transaction behavior
- Identify distinct spending and usage patterns
- Support customer profiling and personalization in banking systems

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Technique
- **K-Means Clustering**
- Type: Unsupervised Learning

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains numerical features related to customer banking transactions, such as:
- Transaction frequency
- Transaction amounts
- Behavioral indicators

**Dataset file:**  
- `case2_banking_kmeans_1000.csv`

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Load and explore transaction data  
2. Preprocess data and apply feature scaling  
3. Determine optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**  
4. Apply K-Means clustering  
5. Visualize clusters  
6. Analyze and interpret customer segments  

---

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Customers are grouped into multiple transaction-based segments  
- Some clusters represent high-frequency or high-value customers  
- Segmentation can be used for targeted banking services and offers
