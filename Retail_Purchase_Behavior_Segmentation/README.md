# Retail Purchase Behavior Segmentation using K-Means

## 📌 Project Description
Retail businesses generate large volumes of customer purchase data.
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on their
purchase behavior and spending patterns.

The segmentation helps retailers understand customer preferences and improve
marketing strategies, inventory planning, and customer engagement.
