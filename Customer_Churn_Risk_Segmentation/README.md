# Customer Churn Risk Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue for service-based businesses such as telecom and subscription platforms.  
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on their behavioral and usage patterns in order to identify groups with higher churn risk.

The goal is to help businesses understand customer behavior and take proactive retention actions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Segment customers into distinct behavioral groups
- Identify potential high-risk churn segments
- Support data-driven customer retention strategies

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- **K-Means Clustering** (Unsupervised Machine Learning)

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains numerical customer attributes related to usage and engagement, suitable for clustering analysis.

**Dataset file:**  
- `case1_telecom_kmeans_1000.csv`

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Data loading and initial exploration  
2. Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
3. Selecting the optimal number of clusters using the **Elbow Method**  
4. Applying K-Means clustering  
5. Visualizing customer segments  
6. Interpreting clusters to assess churn risk  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Customers are grouped into distinct segments based on behavior  
- Certain clusters indicate lower engagement and higher churn probability  
- These insights can be used for targeted retention campaigns  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **unsupervised learning** can uncover hidden customer behavior patterns without labeled churn data.  
K-Means clustering provides actionable insights that businesses can use to reduce customer churn and improve retention strategies.
